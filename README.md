HASURA PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT FELLOWSHIP

8-week internship program to build a complete app from scratch.

Getting Started

During this internship the responsibilities of developing front-end and back-end is assigned to the interns based on their preferences. As I preferred back-end (python-flask), I was allotted with it. As a warm up session for the program we were given seven tasks in the preferred domain to test our individual skills. Here are the list of those seven tasks:

Week - 1
1.  A simple hello-world at http://localhost:8080/ that displays a simple string like "Hello World - Arpit"; replace "Arpit" with your own first name).
2.	Add a route, for e.g. http://localhost:8080/authors, which:
a.	fetches a list of authors from a request to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
b.	fetches a list of posts from a request to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
c.	Respond with only a list of authors and the count of their posts (a newline for each author).
3.	Set a simple cookie (if it has not already been set) at http://localhost:8080/setcookie with the following values: name=<your-first-name> and age=<your-age>.
4.	Fetch the set cookie with http://localhost:8080/getcookies and display the stored key-values in it.
5.	Deny requests to your http://localhost:8080/robots.txt page. (or you can use the response at http://httpbin.org/deny if needed)
6.	Render an HTML page at http://localhost:8080/html or an image at http://localhost:8080/image.
7.	A text box at http://localhost:8080/input which sends the data as POST to any endpoint of your choice. This endpoint should log the received the received to stdout.
